        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimal Substructure</li>
            <li>Overlapping Subproblems</li>
            <li>State Representation</li>
            <li>Transition Formula</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Memoization (Top-Down)</h4>
        <p>
            Memoization uses recursion and stores previously computed results to avoid repeated calculations.
        </p>

        <h4>Tabulation (Bottom-Up)</h4>
        <p>
            Tabulation builds solutions iteratively using a table starting from base cases.
        </p>

        <h4>Common DP Patterns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fibonacci Pattern</li>
            <li>0/1 Knapsack</li>
            <li>Longest Common Subsequence</li>
            <li>Longest Increasing Subsequence</li>
            <li>Coin Change</li>
            <li>Matrix Chain Multiplication</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Visual Flow</h4>

            Introduction:
            Greedy Algorithms build a solution step by step by always choosing the locally optimal choice at each stage.

            Greedy Approach:
            • Choose the best available option.
            • Add it to the solution.
            • Never reconsider previous choices.
            • Repeat until the solution is complete.

            Advantages:
            • Easy to understand and implement.
            • Fast execution.
            • Memory efficient.
            • Useful for optimization problems.

            Limitations:
            • Does not always guarantee the optimal solution.
            • Works only for problems with the greedy-choice property.
            • Requires proof of correctness.

            Common Problems:
            • Activity Selection

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            Backtracking is a systematic search technique that builds solutions incrementally and abandons invalid paths.
        </p>

        <h4>Decision Tree Concept</h4>
        <p>
            Each decision creates branches in a decision tree. Invalid branches are pruned early.
        </p>

        <h4>State Space Search</h4>
        <p>
            Backtracking explores the state space using depth-first search.
        </p>
        <h4>Example: N-Queens Problem</h4>
<p>
Place 4 queens on a 4×4 chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
Backtracking places queens row by row and removes a queen whenever a conflict is found.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Try placing Queen in Row 1</li>
    <li>Move to Row 2 and check safety</li>
    <li>If conflict occurs, backtrack</li>
    <li>Try another position</li>
    <li>Continue until a valid solution is found</li>
</ul>

        <h4>Classic Problems</h4>

            <li>N Queens</li>

        <h3>Introduction to DSU</h3>

        <p>
        Disjoint Set Union (DSU), also known as Union-Find,
        is a data structure used to maintain a collection
        of non-overlapping sets.
        </p>


        <h3>Find Operation</h3>

        <p>
        Find operation determines the representative/root
        element of a set.
        </p>


        <h3>Union Operation</h3>

        <p>
        Union operation combines two different sets into
        a single set.
        </p>


        <h3>Path Compression</h3>

        <p>
        Path compression optimizes the Find operation by
        making every node point directly to the root.
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction to Segment Tree</h3>

        <p>
        A Segment Tree is a binary tree used for answering range queries
        like sum, minimum, maximum efficiently in O(log n).
        </p>

        <h3>Construction</h3>

        <p>
        The array is recursively divided into segments and stored in a tree structure.
        </p>

        <h3>Query Operation</h3>

        <p>
        Range queries are answered by combining results of relevant segments.
        </p>

        <h3>Update Operation</h3>

        <p>
        Updates modify a value and propagate changes up the tree.

        <li><strong>O(log N) - Logarithmic:</strong> The problem size is divided in half at each step (e.g., Binary Search).</li>
        <li><strong>O(N) - Linear:</strong> Time increases proportionally with input size (e.g., traversing an array or linked list, linear search).</li>
        <li><strong>O(N log N) - Linearithmic:</strong> Efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).</li>

        <strong>Key Insight (Hash Set):</strong><br>• Convert nums1 into a Set for O(1) lookups<br>• Iterate nums2 and check membership in the Set<br>• Store matches in a result Set to avoid duplicates<br><br>
